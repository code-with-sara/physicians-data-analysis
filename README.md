This encompassed a variety of tasks designed to integrate data analysis and machine learning methodologies into healthcare operations. The first task focused on merging source files, where datasets from different hospital management systems were combined into a cohesive master DataFrame. This process ensured data integrity by identifying and resolving missing values. The next task involved generating a list of scheduling facilities, enabling the extraction of facilities scheduled for a specific date through filtering and aggregation techniques.
A similar approach was applied to create a list of scheduling physicians, highlighting the physicians active on specific dates. To delve deeper into operational analysis, a credential index was calculated, forming a priority matrix for physicians and facilities based on activity levels. Building on this, a priority schedule was devised by analyzing physician-facility schedules, using conditional logic to determine the priority levels.
